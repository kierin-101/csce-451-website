      Hi, I'm Kierin. I'm a student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and I'm an SE major.

        Pitivi is a free and open-source video editor for Linux. It is written in Python and uses the GStreamer
        multimedia framework. My team "contributed" (the changes were never submitted in a merge request) a new feautre
        that allowed the user to essentially bookmark points in their video timeline, give the bookmakrs names, do
        things like that.

        (It was kinda boring, but it was a good learning experience. I learned a lot about the Git workflow and how to
        work with a team of developers. I learned a lot about the GStreamer framework and how to work with it. I also
        <i>also</i> learned that I don't like working with GStreamer.)

        Sorry for the ugly white background on the logo. I couldn't find a good image of the logo with a transparent
        background.

        The Agricultural Input Origination Software (long name, blame the client)
        is a web application that allows users from Henderson State Bank and their customers to edit,
        view, and create loans. I worked on the front-end of the application, using ReactJS
        and TypeScript to create a User Interface for the application.

      <p>
        I have been a TA for CSCE 231 for the past two semesters. As I'm not a GTA yet, I didn't have to deal with
        grading or holding recitation, but I do hold office hours in the dungeon that is Avery 12 and lead 2 lab
        sections a week. I also unofficially help students over Discord via the 231 server.
